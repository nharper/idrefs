<t>Newer high-speed public Internet access technologies call for a high- speed modem to have a local area network (LAN) attachment to one or more customer premise hosts.  It is advantageous to use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) as defined in RFC 2131 to assign customer premise host IP addresses in this environment.

This option extends the set of DHCP options as defined in RFC 2132. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
