<abstract>
<t>This memo provides an update and clarification to RFC 1811.  This document describes the registration policies for the top-level domain ".GOV".  Thus far, Federal Agencies and their subsidiaries have registered without any guidance.  This has resulted in multiple registrations for Federal Agencies and naming schemes that do not facilitate responsiveness to the public.  This document fixes this by restricting registrations to coincide with the approved structure of the US government.  The document cited, FIPS 95-1, provides a standard recognized structure into which domain registrations for .GOV can be fit.  This policy is exactly comparable to that for the top-level domains.  The IANA requires that an organization/country
   apply for and get a 2 letter code from ISO/ITU (e.g., US for United States) for additional top-level registration.</t>
<t>As a side effect, this reduces the number of .GOV level registrations and reduces the workload on the Internic.</t></abstract></front>
