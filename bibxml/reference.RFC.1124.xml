<abstract>
<t>To support the activities of the Federal Research Internet Coordinating Committee (FRICC) in creating an interconnected set of networks to serve the research community, two workshops were held to address the technical support of policy issues that arise when interconnecting such networks.  Held under the suspices of the Internet Activities Board at the request of the FRICC, and sponsored by NASA through RIACS, the workshops addressed the required and feasible technologies and architectures that could be used to satisfy the desired policies for interconnection.  The purpose of this RFC is to report the results of these workshops.</t></abstract></front>
