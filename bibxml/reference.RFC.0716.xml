<abstract>
<t>Over the past few months we have become aware that there has been some confusion as to how to operate a Host connected to an IMP as a Very Distant Host (or VDH).  Therefore, next time BBN Report 1822 ("Specifications for the Interconnection of a Host and an IMP") is revised, we will include additional information on how the IMP side of a VDH connection works and how the Host side may operate most efficiently.  As an interim measure, we are distributing this RFC which takes the form of a (logical) update to Appendix F of BBN Report 1822.</t></abstract></front>
