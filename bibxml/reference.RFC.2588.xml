<abstract>
<t>Many organizations use a firewall computer that acts as a security
gateway between the public Internet and their private, internal
'intranet'.
In this document, we discuss the issues surrounding the
traversal of IP multicast traffic across a firewall, and describe
possible ways in which a firewall can implement and control this
traversal.
We also explain why some firewall mechanisms - such as
SOCKS - that were designed specifically for unicast traffic, are less
appropriate for multicast.</t></abstract></front>
