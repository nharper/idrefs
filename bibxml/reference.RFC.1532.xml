<abstract>
<t>Some aspects of the BOOTP protocol were rather loosely defined in its original specification.  In particular, only a general description was provided for the behavior of "BOOTP relay agents" (originally called BOOTP forwarding agents").  The client behavior description also suffered in certain ways.  This memo attempts to clarify and strengthen the specification in these areas.</t>
<t>In addition, new issues have arisen since the original specification was written.  This memo also attempts to address some of these.</t></abstract></front>
