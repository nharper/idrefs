<abstract>
<t>The PIER [Procedures for Internet/Enterprise Renumbering] working group is compiling a series of documents to assist and instruct organizations in their efforts to renumber.  However, it is becoming apparent that, with the increasing number of new Internet Service Providers (ISP's) and organizations getting connected to the Internet for the first time, the concept of network renumbering needs to be further defined.  This document attempts to clearly define the concept of network renumbering and discuss some of the more pertinent reasons why an organization would have a need to do so.</t></abstract></front>
