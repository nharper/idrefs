<abstract>
<t>This document provides an analysis grid to evaluate, compare, and contrast the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocol suite capabilities with the recovery mechanisms currently proposed at the IETF CCAMP Working Group.  A detailed analysis of each of the recovery phases is provided using the terminology defined in RFC 4427.  This document focuses on transport plane survivability and recovery issues and not on control plane resilience and related aspects.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>
