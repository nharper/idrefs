<abstract>
<t>There has been much discussion and several documents written about
the need for an Internet Directory.
Recently, this discussion has
focused on ways to discover an organization's domain name without
relying on use of DNS as a directory service.
This memo discusses
lessons that were learned during InterNIC Directory and Database
Services' development and operation of WWWSeeker, an application that
finds a web site given information about the name and location of an
organization.
The back end database that drives this application was
built from information obtained from domain registries via WHOIS and
other protocols.
We present this information to help future
implementors avoid some of the blind alleys that we have already
explored.
This work builds on the Netfind system that was created by
Mike Schwartz and his team at the University of Colorado at Boulder.</t></abstract></front>
