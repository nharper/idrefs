<abstract>
<t>Interoperability problems have been observed with erroneous labelling of paragraph text as Text/Plain, and with various forms of "embarrassing line wrap." (See section 3.)</t>
<t>Attempts to deploy new media types, such asText/EnrichedandText/HTMLhave suffered from a lack of backwards compatibility and an often hostile user reaction at the receiving end.</t>
<t>What is required is a format which is in all significant ways Text/Plain, and therefore is quite suitable for display as Text/Plain, and yet allows the sender to express to the receiver
which lines can be considered a logical paragraph, and thus flowed (wrapped and joined) as appropriate.</t>
<t>This memo proposes a new parameter to be used with Text/Plain, and, in the presence of this parameter, the use of trailing whitespace to indicate flowed lines. This results in an encoding which appears as normal Text/Plain in older implementations, since it is in fact normal Text/Plain.</t></abstract></front>
