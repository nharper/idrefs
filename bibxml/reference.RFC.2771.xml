<abstract>
<t>This document describes the "abstract service interface" for the dynamic multicast address allocation service, as seen by applications.  While it does not describe a concrete API (i.e., for a specific programming language), it describes - in abstract terms -  the semantics of this service, including the guarantees that it makes to applications.</t>
<t>Additional documents (not necessarily products of the IETF) would describe concrete APIs for this service.</t></abstract></front>
