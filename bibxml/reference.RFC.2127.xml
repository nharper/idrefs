<abstract>
<t>
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a minimal set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based management of ISDN terminal interfaces.  ISDN interfaces are
   supported on a variety of equipment (for data and voice) including
   terminal adapters, bridges, hosts, and routers.
</t>
<t>
   This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to
   the SNMPv2 SMI.  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP
   framework and existing SNMP standards.
</t>
<t>
   This document is a product of the ISDN MIB working group within the
   Internet Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should
   be addressed to the working group&apos;s mailing list at isdn-
   mib@cisco.com and/or the author.

<t>
   The current version of this document reflects changes made during the
   last call period and the IESG review.
