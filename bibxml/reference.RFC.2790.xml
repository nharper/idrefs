<abstract>
<t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. This memo obsoletes RFC 1514, the "Host Resources MIB". This memo extends that specification by clarifying changes based on implementation and deployment experience and documenting the Host Resources MIB in SMIv2 format while remaining semantically identical to the existing SMIv1-based MIB.</t>
<t>This memo defines a MIB for use with managing host systems.  The term "host" is construed to mean any computer that communicates with other similar computers attached to the internet and that is directly used by one or more human beings. Although this MIB does not necessarily apply to devices whose primary function is communications services    (e.g., terminal servers, routers, bridges, monitoring equipment), such relevance is not explicitly precluded.  This MIB instruments attributes common to all internet hosts including, for example, both personal computers and systems that run variants of Unix.</t></abstract></front>
