<abstract>
<t>This document specifies an IPv4-to-IPv6 transition mechanism, in addition to those already specified in. This solution attempts to provide transparent routing, as defined in, to end-nodes in V6 realm trying to communicate with end-nodes in V4 realm and vice versa. This is achieved using a combination of Network Address Translation and Protocol Translation. The scheme described does not mandate dual-stacks (i.e., IPv4 as well as V6 protocol support) or special purpose routing requirements (such as requiring tunneling support) on end nodes. This scheme is based on a combination of address translation theme as described inand V6/V4 protocol translation theme as described in.</t></abstract></front>
