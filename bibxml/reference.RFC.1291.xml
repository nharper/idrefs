<abstract>
<t>This document proposes a set of technical services that each Internet mid-level network can offer within the mid-level network itself and to its peer networks. The term "mid-level" is used as a generic term to represent all regional and similar networks, which, due to continuous evolutions and transitions, can no longer be termed "regional" [MAN]. It discusses the pros and cons of offering these services, as well as areas in which mid-level networks can work together.</t>
<t>A large portion of the ideas stem from discussions at the IETF Operational Statistics (OPstat), User Connectivity Problems (UCP) and Network Joint Management (NJM) working groups.</t></abstract></front>
