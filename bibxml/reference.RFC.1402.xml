<abstract>
<t>A wealth of information exists on the network.  In fact, there is so much information that you could spend your entire life browsing. This paper will present some of the "gold nuggets" of information and file repositories on the network that could be useful.</t>
<t>The ultimate goal is to make the route to these sources of information invisible to you.  At present, this is not easy to do.  I will explain some of the techniques that can be used to make these nuggets easier to pick up so that we all can be richer.</t></abstract></front>
