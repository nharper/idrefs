<abstract>
<t>There are several aspects of the File Transfer Protocol of RFC 542 that constitute serious drawbacks. Some of these are quite basic in nature, and imply substantial design changes; these will be discussed in a later RFC. Others could be remedied with very little effort, and this should be done as soon as possible.</t></abstract></front>
