<abstract>
<t>This RFCconsiders X.500 in relation to Internet and UK Domains.  A basic model of X.500 providing a higher level and more descriptive naming structure is emphasised.  In addition, a mapping of domains onto X.500 is proposed, which gives a range of new management and user facilities over and above those currently available.  This specification proposes an experimental new mechanism to access and manage domain information on the Internet and in the UK Academic Community.  There is no current intention to provide an operational replacement for DNS.</t></abstract></front>
