<abstract>
<t>This document describes the current status of the development and deployment of CIDR technology into the Internet. This document replaces RFC 1367, which was a schedule for the deployment of IP address space management procedures to support route aggregation. Since all the milestones proposed in RFC 1367 except for the delivery and installation of CIDR software were met, it does not seem appropriate to issue an updated schedule. Rather, this document is intended to provide information about how this effort is proceeding, which may be of interest to the community.</t></abstract></front>
