<abstract>
<t>DHCPv6 relay agents cannot communicate with DHCPv6 clients directly. However, in some cases, the relay agent possesses some information that would be useful to the DHCPv6 client. This document describes a mechanism whereby the DHCPv6 relay agent can provide such information to the DHCPv6 server, which can, in turn, pass this information on to the DHCP client.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document updates RFC 3315 (DHCPv6) by making explicit the implicit requirement that relay agents not modify the content of encapsulation payloads as they are relayed back toward clients.
