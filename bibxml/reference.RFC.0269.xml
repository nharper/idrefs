<abstract>
<t>At UCLA-NMC we have recently completed implementation of a program which utilizes UCSB's storage capability via their Simple Minded File System (See RFC #122by Jim White for a description of SMFS).  The use of the program is detailed in Appendix A.</t>
<t>We learned a number of things in the implementation effort and subsequent usage.  We think a number of these apply towards the development of a net- word-wide File Transfer Protocol, and we hope to stimulate further dis- cussion of these issues.  We discovered some things in the UCSB protocol that we would like to see included in the network-wide protocol, and we see some things that are in the currently proposed net protocol and are unfortunately absent from the UCSB protocol.</t></abstract></front>
