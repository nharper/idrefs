<abstract>
<t>This memo describes an experimental protocol developed by a project team at Cray Research, Inc., in implementing support for circuit-switched T3 services.  The protocol is used for the control of network connections external to a host, but known to the host.  It is documented here for the benefit of others who may wish to perform further research.</t>
<t>While working with circuit-switched T3 networks, developers at Cray Research, Inc., defined a model wherein a host would generate control messages for a network switch.  This work is described in RFC  1306, "Experiences Supporting By-Request Circuit-Switched T3 Networks".  In order to simplify the model it was decided that the inconsistencies of switch control should be hidden from the host generating the
   control messages.  To that end, a protocol was defined and implemented.  This RFC documents the Dynamically Switched Link Control Protocol (DSLCP), which is used for creation and control of downstream network links by a host.</t></abstract></front>
