<abstract>
<t>This document describes a simple, interoperable mechanism that can be employed in Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) networks in order to decrease the data loss associated with deterministic blackholing of packets during transient network conditions.  The mechanism proposed here requires no IS-IS protocol changes and is completely interoperable with the existing IS-IS specification.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>
