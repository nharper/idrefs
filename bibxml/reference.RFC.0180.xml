<abstract>
<t>As noted in RFC #164(page 35), a subcommittee of the NWG, under the chairmanship of Abhay Bhushan, is currently generating proposals for a "data transfer protocol" and a "file transfer protocol".</t>
<t>The subcommittee has decided that the file transfer protocol should provide standard methods for requesting the transfer of a file but should not, at this time, attempt to standardize file naming conventions, access control conventions, and the like.  Thus a user who is, for example, trying to store a file on a remote Host will be required to use the file naming conventions appropriate to the remote Host.</t>
<t>Given the above point of view, it becomes imperative for users to have some source of information about Host file conventions.</t></abstract></front>
