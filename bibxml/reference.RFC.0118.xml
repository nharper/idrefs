<abstract>
<t>INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR EACH SERVICE AVAILABLE TO THE NETWORK</t>
<t>There are two classes of information which a site needs to provide for each service or process it makes available over the Network:</t>
<t>i) information required by system programmers in order to establish a connection to the facility</t>
<t>ii) information required by a user to gain access to and use the facility</t>
<t>The above two basic kinds of information which need to be in each facility description will comprise a "functional document" (see RFC 115, NIC (5822,) for a description of functional documents and recommended procedures for updating them).</t></abstract></front>
