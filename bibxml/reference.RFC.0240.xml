<abstract>
<t>Due to extensive typographic errors in RFC #235, I have decided to reissue the first of our experimental site status reports.</t>
<t>In compiling RFC #235, I followed the principle that timeliness was somewhat more important than extremely careful editing; this seemed to me to be in keeping with the original RFC philosophy.  I am sorry for any embarrassment this may have caused to anyone associated with the Network, and accept full responsibility for the content of RFC #235.  I will try to do a better job in the future.</t></abstract></front>
