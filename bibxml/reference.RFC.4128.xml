<t>"Differentiated Services (Diffserv)-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering Requirements", RFC 3564, specifies the requirements and selection criteria for Bandwidth Constraints Models.  Two such models, the Maximum Allocation and the Russian Dolls, are described therein.  This document complements RFC 3564 by presenting the results of a performance evaluation of these two models under various operational conditions: normal load, overload, preemption fully or partially enabled, pure blocking, or complete sharing.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>
