<abstract>
<t>A companion document describes an architecture for providing
integrated services over low-bitrate links, such as modem lines, ISDN
B-channels, and sub-T1 links. The main components of the architecture are: a real-time encapsulation format for asynchronous
and synchronous low-bitrate links, a header compression architecture
optimized for real-time flows, elements of negotiation protocols used
between routers (or between hosts and routers), and announcement
protocols used by applications to allow this negotiation to take
place.</t>
<t>This document proposes the suspend/resume-oriented solution for the real-time encapsulation format part of the architecture. The general
approach is to start from the PPP Multilink fragmentation protocoland its multi-class extensionand add suspend/resume in a way that is as compatible to existing hard- and firmware as possible.</t></abstract></front>
