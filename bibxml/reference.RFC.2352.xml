<t>
   This RFC is an independent submission that discusses a possible
   convention for allocating domain names based on corporate and other
   names as registered by law.
</t>
<t>
   It appears to depend on corporations changing their domain names from
   their present form to more cumbersome handles, such as changing
   cisco.com to cisco-systems.co.ca.us or ibm.com to international-
   business-machines.co.ny.us, without giving them an incentive to do
   so, such as deprecating the .com and .net gTLDs.  It also appears to
   legislate the structure each national registry applies to its name
   space, something which the document itself asserts is within national
   purview and not for global standardization.
</t>
<t>
   It may not be politically feasible to implement as described.
