<abstract>
<t>A review of the Initial Connection Protocol (ICP) first described in RFC #66and restated in RFC #80has revealed an area of ambiguity, which in turn reflects an ambiguity in the Host-Host Protocol Document No. 1.  This is the definition of the message sent over the connection from "Server socket #1".  In both referenced RFC's, the message is defined as "exactly an even 32 bit number".  It is not clear, however, whether this 32 bit number is meant to follow an eight-bit "message data type" code or not, stemming from the fact that the Host-Host Protocol makes provision for such codes but does not seem to absolutely demand them.</t></abstract></front>
