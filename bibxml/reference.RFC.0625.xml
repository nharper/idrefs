<abstract>
<t>We agree with the suggestion in RFC 623 that more than one Host should be responsible for maintaining a copy of the Hostnames data base. The NIC is certainly willing to continue to maintain the master data base, and make it available to any secondary Host that volunteers to maintain a copy. We would be pleased to have UCSB serve as one of the secondary Hosts.</t></abstract></front>
