<abstract>
<t>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to manipulate configuration datastores.  However, client applications often need to be aware of common events, such as a change in NETCONF server capabilities, that may impact management applications.  Standard mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of the base system events within the NETCONF server.  This document defines a YANG module that allows a NETCONF client to receive notifications for some common system events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
