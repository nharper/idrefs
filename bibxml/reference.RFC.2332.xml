   This document describes the NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP).

   NHRP can be used by a source station (host or router) connected to a

   Non-Broadcast, Multi-Access (NBMA) subnetwork to determine the

   internetworking layer address and NBMA subnetwork addresses of the

   "NBMA next hop" towards a destination station.  If the destination is

   connected to the NBMA subnetwork, then the NBMA next hop is the

   destination station itself.  Otherwise, the NBMA next hop is the

   egress router from the NBMA subnetwork that is "nearest" to the

   destination station.  NHRP is intended for use in a multiprotocol

   internetworking layer environment over NBMA subnetworks.

   Note that while this protocol was developed for use with NBMA

   subnetworks, it is possible, if not likely, that it will be applied

   to BMA subnetworks as well.  However, this usage of NHRP is for

   further study.

<t>

   This document is intended to be a functional superset of the NBMA

   Address Resolution Protocol (NARP) documented in [1].

   Operation of NHRP as a means of establishing a transit path across an

   NBMA subnetwork between two routers will be addressed in a separate

   document (see [13]).
