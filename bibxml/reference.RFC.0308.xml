<t>Several months ago a SURVEY program was implemented on the MIT-DMCG ITS PDP-10 system to aid in gathering information on the availability of various HOSTS on the ARPANET.  The purpose of this Request for Comments is threefold:</t>
<t>1. to inform the Network Working Group of the existence of this information gathering service and about getting access to it, 2. to present the results of SURVEY for its first few months, and 3. to correct errors in our data or collection methods.</t></abstract></front>
