<t>A mobile node needs at least the following information: a home address, a home agent address, and a security association with home agent to register with the home agent.  The process of obtaining this information is called bootstrapping.  This document discusses issues involved with how the mobile node can be bootstrapped for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) and various potential deployment scenarios for mobile node bootstrapping.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>
