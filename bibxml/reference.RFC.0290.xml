<t>The bibliography is broken into seven subject areas - general data structures, data description, data conversion, data management, data security, data transmission, and computer network design.  Two of these areas, general data structures and data management, cover a very broad range of subjects: however, in these two areas, only entries that seem to be specially pertinent to computer networks and data sharing are included.  The bibliography also contains an index of authors.</t></abstract></front>
