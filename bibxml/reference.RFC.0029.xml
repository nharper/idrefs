<abstract>
<t>A "millisecond" clock should be satisfactory for most network measurements. Round-trip message transit times typically should be at least on the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds.  The IMP contains a 16-bit hardware clock which is incremented every 100 microseconds to allow for timing of internal events within the IMP, as for example, during tracing.However, most measurements are made using a 25.6 ms. software clock.</t></abstract></front>
