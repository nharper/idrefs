<abstract>
<t>
   The process by which the members of the IAB and IESG are selected,
   confirmed, and recalled is specified.  The evolution of the process
   has relied principally on oral tradition as a means by which the
   lessons learned could be passed on to successive committees.  This
   document is a self-consistent, organized compilation of the process
   as it is known today.
