<abstract>
<t>We are currently considering a redefinition of the IMP-to-Host error message types (type 1 and type 8) and the creation of additional IMP-to-Host error message types.  We believe that these changes will assist the Hosts in determining appropriate recovery action, without causing any serious reprogramming problems.  Our current plans are to install these changes within a few months; therefore we should be informed of any strong negative reactions relatively quickly.</t></abstract></front>
