<abstract>
<t>This memorandum describes the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP),  which is an adaptation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) used to synchronize computer clocks in the Internet. SNTP can be used when the ultimate performance of the full NTP implementation described in RFC-1305 is not needed or justified. It involves no change to the current or previous NTP specification versions or known implementations, but rather a clarification of certain design features of NTP which allow operation in a simple, stateless RPC mode with accuracy and reliability expectations similar to the UDP/TIME protocol described in RFC-868.</t>
<t>This memorandum does not obsolete or update any RFC. A working knowledge of RFC-1305 is not required for an implementation of SNTP.</t></abstract></front>
