<abstract>
<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is increasingly being used in systems that are tightly coupled with Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) servers for a variety of reasons.  In many of these cases, applications can benefit from being able to discover, in near real- time, when a specific HTTP resource is created, changed, or deleted.  This document proposes a mechanism, based on the SIP Event Framework, for doing so. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
