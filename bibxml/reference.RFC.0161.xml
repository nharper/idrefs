<abstract>
<t>In NWG/RFC #143a race condition in the ICP was described and a solution was suggested. The problem arises because the Host-Host protocol does not specify what the NCP should do when it gets more than one request of STR (or RTS) to the same socket. As a result this decision depends on the particular implementation: some may queue these requests (SDC for example), some will refuse a request if the socket is already connected (UCLA for example), etc.</t></abstract></front>
