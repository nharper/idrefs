<abstract>
<t>
   The goal of the Internet Nomenclator Project is to integrate the
   hundreds of publicly available CCSO servers from around the world.
   Each CCSO server has a database schema that is tailored to the needs
   of the organization that owns it.  The project is integrating the
   different database schema into one query service.  The Internet
   Nomenclator Project will provide fast cross-server searches for
   locating people on the Internet.  It augments existing CCSO services
   by supplying schema integration, more extensive indexing, and two
   kinds of caching -- all this in a system that scales as the number of
   CCSO servers grows.  One of the best things about the system is that
   administrators can incorporate their CCSO servers into Nomenclator
   without changing the servers. All Nomenclator needs is basic
   information about the server.

<t>
   This document provides an overview of the Nomenclator system,
   describes how to register a CCSO server in the Internet Nomenclator
   Project, and how to use the Nomenclator search engine to find people
   on the Internet.
