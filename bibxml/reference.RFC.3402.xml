<t>This document describes the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) algorithm for applying dynamically retrieved string transformation rules to an application-unique string.  Well-formed transformation rules will reflect the delegation of management of information associated with the string.  This document is also part of a series that is completely specified in "Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS" (RFC 3401).  It is very important to note that it is impossible to read and understand any document in this series without reading the others. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
