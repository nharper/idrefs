<abstract>
<t>The goal of this FYI RFC, produced by the Internet School Networking (ISN) group in the User Services Area of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), is to document the questions most commonly asked about the Internet by those in the primary and secondary school community, and to provide pointers to sources which answer those questions.  It is directed at educators, school media specialists, and school administrators who are recently connected to the Internet, who are accessing the Internet via dial-up or another means which is not a direct connection, or who are considering an Internet connection as a resource for their schools.</t></abstract></front>
