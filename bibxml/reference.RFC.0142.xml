<abstract>
<t>On sending a message to a foreign site, the following situations can occur:</t>
<t>1. Destination IMP down - Type 7 message is returned.</t>
<t>2. Destination IMP up but destination IMP-HOST interface is down - Type 7 message is returned.</t>
<t>3. Destination IMP and IMP-HOST interface up, but IMP-HOST inter-face is not taking messages - Type 9 message is returned after IMP time-out (ask BBN for time).</t>
<t>4. Destination IMP and IMP-HOST interface up and IMP-HOST interface is taking messages - Type 5 (rfnm) message is returned.</t>
<t>A suggestion for handling type 7 and type 9 messages has been made in NWG/RFC #117.  In this document we would like to discuss in detail the problem: what should happen to the HOST-HOST protocol on receiving a rfnm?</t></abstract></front>
