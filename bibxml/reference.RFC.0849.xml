<t>This RFC may be something unique among modern-day RFC's, an RFC that actually is a request for comments.  The issue dealt with is that of a naming registry update procedure, both as exists currently and what could exist in the future.  None of the proposed solutions are intended as standards at this time; rather it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as the appropriate solution, leaving eventually to the
adoption of standards.</t></abstract></front>
