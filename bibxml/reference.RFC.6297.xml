<abstract>
<t>This document provides a survey of transport protocols that are designed to have a smaller bandwidth and/or delay impact on standard TCP than standard TCP itself when they share a bottleneck with it.  Such protocols could be used for delay-insensitive "background" traffic, as they provide what is sometimes called a "less than" (or "lower than") best-effort service.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract></front>
