<abstract>
<t>This document describes the use and detailed design of Route Servers for dissemination of routing information among BGP/IDRP speaking routers.</t>
<t>The intention of the proposed technique is to reduce overhead and management complexity of maintaining numerous direct BGP/IDRP sessions which otherwise might be required or desired among routers within a single routing domain as well as among routers in different domains that are connected to a common switched fabric (e.g. an ATM cloud).</t></abstract></front>
