<abstract>
<t>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) update operations, such as Add, Delete, and Modify operations, have atomic, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) properties.  Each of these update operations act upon an entry.  It is often desirable to update two or more entries in a single unit of interaction, a transaction.
