<abstract>
<t>The OSI Directory has user friendly naming as a goal.  A simple minded usage of the directory does not achieve this.  Two aspects not achieved are:</t>
<t>o A user oriented notation</t>
<t>o Guessability</t>
<t>This proposal sets out some conventions for representing names in a friendly manner, and shows how this can be used to achieve really friendly naming.  This then leads to a specification of a format for representing names, and to procedures to resolve them.  This leads to a specification which allows directory names to be communicated between humans.  The format in this specification is identical to that defined in [HK93], and it is intended that these specifications are compatible.  Please send comments to the author or to the discussion group: osi-ds@CS.UCL.AC.UK.</t></abstract></front>
