<abstract>
<t>This document is intended to be a source of information about the Russian Federal standard hash function (GOST R 34.11-94), which is one of the Russian cryptographic standard algorithms (called GOST algorithms).  Recently, Russian cryptography is being used in Internet applications, and this document has been created as information for developers and users of GOST R 34.11-94 for hash computation.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract></front>
