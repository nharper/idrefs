<t>With the ARPA Network Host-to-Host  Protocol  specified  and  at least  partially  implemented at a number of sites, the question of what steps should be taken next arises. There  appears  to  be  a  widespread feeling  among  Network  participants  that the first step should be the specification and implementation of what has  been  called  the  "Logger Protocol";  the  Computer  Network Group at project MAC agrees. The term "logger" has been commonly used to indicate the basic mechanism to  gain access  (to  "login")  to  a  system from a console. A network logger is intended to specify how the existing logger of  a  network  host  is  to interface to the network so as to permit a login from a console attached to another host.</t></abstract></front>
