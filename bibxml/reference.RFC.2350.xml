<abstract>
<t>

   The purpose of this document is to express the general Internet

   community's expectations of Computer Security Incident Response Teams

   (CSIRTs). It is not possible to define a set of requirements that

   would be appropriate for all teams, but it is possible and helpful to

   list and describe the general set of topics and issues which are of

   concern and interest to constituent communities.
</t>
<t>


   CSIRT constituents have a legitimate need and right to fully

   understand the policies and procedures of 'their' Computer Security

   Incident Response Team.  One way to support this understanding is to

   supply detailed information which users may consider, in the form of

   a formal template completed by the CSIRT.  An outline of such a

   template and a filled in example are provided.
