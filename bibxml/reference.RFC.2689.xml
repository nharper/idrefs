<abstract>
<t>This document describes an architecture for providing integrated services over low-bitrate links, such as modem lines, ISDN B-channels, and sub-T1 links.  It covers only the lower parts of the Internet Multimedia Conferencing Architecture; additional components required for application services such as Internet Telephony (e.g., a session initiation protocol) are outside the scope of this document.  The main components of the architecture are: a real-time encapsulation format for asynchronous and synchronous low- bitrate links, a header compression architecture optimized for real-time flows, elements of negotiation protocols used between routers (or between hosts and routers), and announcement protocols used by applications to allow this negotiation to take place.</t></abstract></front>
