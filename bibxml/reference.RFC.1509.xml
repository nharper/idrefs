<abstract>
<t>This document specifies C language bindings for the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), which is described at a language-independent conceptual level in other documents.</t>
<t>The Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) provides security services to its callers, and is intended for implementation atop alternative underlying cryptographic mechanisms. Typically, GSS-API callers will be application protocols into which security enhancements are integrated through invocation of services provided by the GSS-API. The GSS-API allows a caller application to authenticate a principal identity associated with a peer application, to delegate rights to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis.</t></abstract></front>
