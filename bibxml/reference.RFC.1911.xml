<abstract>
<t>A class of special-purpose computers has evolved to provide voice messaging services.  These machines generally interface to a telephone switch and provide call answering and voice messaging services.  Traditionally, messages sent to a non-local machine are transported using analog networking protocols based on DTMF signaling and analog voice playback.  As the demand for networking increases, there is a need for a standard high-quality digital protocol to connect these machines.  The following document is a profile of the
   Internet standard MIME and ESMTP protocols for use as a digital voice networking protocol.</t>
<t>This profile is based on an earlier effort in the Audio Message Interchange Specification (AMIS) group to define a voice messaging protocol based on X.400 technology.  This protocol is intended to satisfy the user requirements statement from that earlier work with the industry standard ESMTP/MIME mail protocol infrastructures already used within corporate internets.  This profile will be called the voice profile in this document.</t></abstract></front>
