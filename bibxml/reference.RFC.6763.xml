<abstract>
<t>This document specifies how DNS resource records are named and structured to facilitate service discovery.  Given a type of service that a client is looking for, and a domain in which the client is looking for that service, this mechanism allows clients to discover a list of named instances of that desired service, using standard DNS queries.  This mechanism is referred to as DNS-based Service Discovery, or DNS-SD.</t></abstract></front>
