<abstract>
<t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular, it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on the IEEE 802.1D-1998 standard between Local Area Network (LAN) segments. Provisions are made for the support of transparent bridging. Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.&lt;/t>&lt;t> The MIB module presented in this memo is a translation of the BRIDGE-MIB defined in RFC 1493 to the SMIv2 syntax.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This memo obsoletes RFC 1493.
