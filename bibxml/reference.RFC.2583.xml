<abstract>
<t>This document provides guidelines for developers of the Next Hop
Resolution Protocol Clients (NHC).
It assumes that the clients are
directly connected to an ATM based NBMA network.
The same principles
will apply to clients connected to other types of NBMA networks.
The
intent is to define the interaction between the NHC code and the
TCP/IP protocol stack of the local host operating system.
The NHC is
capable of sending NHRP requests to a Next Hop Resolution Protocol
Server (NHS) to resolve both inter and intra LIS addresses.
The NHS
reply may be positive (ACK) indicating a short-cut path is available
or negative (NAK) indicating that a shortcut is not available and the
routed path must be used.
The NHC must cache (maintain state) for
both the ACK and NAK replies in order to use the correct shortcut or
routed path.
The NAK reply must be cached to avoid making repeated
requests to the NHS when the routed path is being used.</t></abstract></front>
