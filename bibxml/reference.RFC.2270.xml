<abstract>
<t>
   With the increased growth of the Internet, the number of customers
   using BGP4 has grown significantly. RFC1930 outlines a set of
   guidelines for when one needs and should use an AS. However, the
   customer and service provider (ISP) are left with a problem as a
   result of this in that while there is no need for an allocated AS
   under the guidelines, certain conditions make the use of BGP4 a very
   pragmatic and perhaps only way to connect a customer homed to a
   single ISP.  This paper proposes a solution to this problem in line
   with recommendations set forth in RFC1930.
