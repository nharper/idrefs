<t>*A typical arrangement of facilities is to have a console attached to a computer at the user's site, and to be using the computational facilities of a remote site.  Information entered by the user is transmitted to the remote Host, and output from the remote Host is transmitted back to the local user.  In this proposal I am concerned with specifying the form of the output stream for the case that the output portion of the console is a typical refresh display with point, vector and character drawing capability. Devices in this class include the DEC 338, DEC 340, IBM 2250, and IMLAC PDS-1.</t></abstract></front>
