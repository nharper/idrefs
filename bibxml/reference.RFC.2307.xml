   This document describes an experimental mechanism for mapping

   entities related to TCP/IP and the UNIX system into X.500 [X500]

   entries so that they may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory

   Access Protocol [RFC2251]. A set of attribute types and object

   classes are proposed, along with specific guidelines for interpreting

   them.
</t>
<t>


   The intention is to assist the deployment of LDAP as an

   organizational nameservice. No proposed solutions are intended as

   standards for the Internet. Rather, it is hoped that a general

   consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solution to such

   problems, leading eventually to the adoption of standards. The

   proposed mechanism has already been implemented with some success.
