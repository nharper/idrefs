<abstract>
<t>
   CBT is a multicast routing architecture that builds a single delivery
   tree per group which is shared by all of the group&apos;s senders and
   receivers.  Most multicast algorithms build one multicast tree per
   sender (subnetwork), the tree being rooted at the sender&apos;s
   subnetwork.  The primary advantage of the shared tree approach is
   that it typically offers more favourable scaling characteristics than
   all other multicast algorithms.
</t>
<t>
   The CBT protocol  is a network layer multicast routing protocol
   that builds and maintains a shared delivery tree for a multicast
   group.  The sending and receiving of multicast data by hosts on a
   subnetwork conforms to the traditional IP multicast service model
   .
</t>
<t>
   CBT is progressing through the IDMR working group of the IETF.  The
   CBT protocol is described in an accompanying document . For this,
   and all IDMR-related documents, see http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/ietf/idmr
