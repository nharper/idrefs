<abstract>
<t>
   This document defines techniques for representing two types of
   information mapping in the OSI Directory .

<list>
<t>
   1.  Mapping from a key to a value (or set of values), as might
       be done in a table lookup.
</t>
<t>
   2.  Mapping from a distinguished name to an associated
       value (or values), where the values are not defined by the owner
       of the entry.  This is achieved by use of a directory subtree.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   These techniques were developed for supporting MHS use of Directory
   , but are specified separately as they have more general
   applicability.
