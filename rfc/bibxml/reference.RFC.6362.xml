<abstract>
<t>The Electronic Data Interchange - Internet Integration (EDIINT) AS1, AS2, and AS3 messages were designed specifically for the transport of EDI documents.  Since multiple interchanges could be placed within a single EDI document, there was not a need for sending multiple EDI documents in a single message.  As adoption of EDIINT grew, other uses developed aside from single EDI document transport.  Some transactions required multiple attachments to be interpreted together and stored in a single message.  This Informational RFC describes how multiple documents, including non-EDI payloads, can be attached and transmitted in a single EDIINT transport message.  The attachments are stored within the MIME multipart/related structure.  A minimal list of content-types to be supported as attachments is provided.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract></front>
