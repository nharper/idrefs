<abstract>
<t>Georgetown University is designing a Learning Resource Center (LRC), part of which may consist of a system to enable computer query (hopefully on-line) of G.U.'s Library holdings.  The ARPA community might be of assistance in either of two ways:</t>
<t>1.  One or more organizations may have a Library Retrieval System that they would like to share with Georgetown</t>
<t>2.  Since there probably are needs for such a system at most organizations, and since it would be highly beneficial for one organization to be able to query other library holdings as well, and subsequently arrange for inter-library loans, the ARPA community might undertake to design a Network Library Information System.</t>
<t>If sufficient interest in such a system exists, a working group could be set up to establish the necessary protocols and iron out details of the system.</t></abstract></front>
