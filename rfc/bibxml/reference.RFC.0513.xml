<abstract>
<t>I would like to make the following comments on the proposed new TELNET Protocol Specification (NIC # 15372) and TELNET Option Specification (NIC 15373).  In general I feel the new TELNET protocol is far superior to the previous version.  There are, however, a few items of substance which I feel should be changed, as well as some recommended editorial changes.</t></abstract></front>
