<abstract>
<t>INETPhone is a true telephone service through the Internet. It integrates the local telephone networks and the Internet using INETPhone servers. Thus a long distance call can be split into two local calls and an Internet connection, which is transparent to end users. Such a phone service through Internet will be a major step towards integrated services on Internet. In order to support the INETPhone and lay down the ground rules of the service, a scheme of "open partnership" is proposed, so that the entire Internet community can have the equal opportunity and benefits from the INETPhone service.</t></abstract></front>
