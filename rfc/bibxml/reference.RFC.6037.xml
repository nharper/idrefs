<abstract>
<t>This document describes the MVPN (Multicast in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs) solution designed and deployed by Cisco Systems.  The procedures specified in this document are largely a subset of the generalized MVPN framework recently standardized by the IETF.  However, as the deployment of the procedures specified herein predates the publication of IETF standards (in some cases by over five years), an implementation based on these procedures differs in some respects from a fully standards-compliant implementation.  These differences are pointed out in the document.  This document defines a Historic Document for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>
