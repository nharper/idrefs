<t>This document aims at organisations who are using local and global electronic communication on a day to day basis and for whom using an electronic White Pages Service is therefore indispensable.</t>
<t>The document provides an introduction to the international ITU-T (formerly CCITT) X.500 and ISO 9594 standard, which is particularly suited for providing an integrated local and global electronic White Pages Service.</t>
<t>In addition a short overview of the experience gained from the Paradise X.500 pilot is given. References to more detailed information are included.</t>
<t>The document should be useful for managers of the above mentioned organisations who need to get the necessary executive commitment for making the address information of their organisation available by means of X.500.</t></abstract></front>
