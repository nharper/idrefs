<abstract>
<t>Broadcasting is a technology that has been largely discarded in favor of technologies like multicast.  This document builds on RFC 919 and describes a more efficient routing mechanism for broadcast packets destined for multiple Local Area Networks (LANs) or Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) using an alternative link layer.  It significantly reduces congestion on network equipment and does not require additional physical infrastructure investment.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract></front>
