<abstract>
<t>RFC 3777 specifies that "sitting members" of the IAB and IESG "may not volunteer to serve on the nominating committee".  Since the time that document was written, the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) was formed; that body is not covered by RFC 3777.  There is also ambiguity in RFC 3777 about whether ex officio members and liaisons are included as "sitting members".  This document updates RFC 3777 to clarify the rules as they apply to members of the IAB, the IESG, and the IAOC.  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</t></abstract></front>
