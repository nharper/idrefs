<abstract>
<t>RFC 1240, "OSI connectionless transport services on top of UDP", was published as a Proposed Standard in June 1991 but at this time there do not seem to be any implementations which follow RFC 1240.  In addition there is a growing concern over using UDP-based transport protocols in environments where congestion is a possibility.</t></abstract></front>
