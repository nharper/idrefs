<abstract>
<t>This memo discusses extension of TCP to provide transaction-oriented service, without altering its virtual-circuit operation.  This extension would fill the large gap between connection-oriented TCP and datagram-based UDP, allowing TCP to efficiently perform many applications for which UDP is currently used.  A separate memo contains a detailed functional specification for this proposed extension.</t>
