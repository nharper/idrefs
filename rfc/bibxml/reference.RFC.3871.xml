<abstract>
<t>This document defines a list of operational security requirements for the infrastructure of large Internet Service Provider (ISP) IP networks (routers and switches).  A framework is defined for specifying "profiles", which are collections of requirements applicable to certain network topology contexts (all, core-only, edge-only...).  The goal is to provide network operators a clear, concise way of communicating their security requirements to vendors.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>
