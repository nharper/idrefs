<abstract>
<t>Professional quality handling of network problems requires some kind of problem tracking system, herein referred to as a "trouble ticket" system.  A basic trouble ticket system acts like a hospital chart, coordinating the work of multiple people who may need to work on the problem.</t>
<t>Once the basic trouble ticket system is in place, however, there are many extensions that can aid Network Operations efficiency. Information in the tickets can be used to produce statistical reports.  Operator efficiency and accuracy may be increased by automating trouble ticket entry with information from the network Alert system.  The Alert system may be used to monitor trouble ticket progress.  Trouble tickets may be also used to communicate network health information between NOCs, to telcom vendors, and to other internal sales and engineering audiences.</t>
<t>This document explores competing uses, architectures, and desirable features of integrated internal trouble ticket systems for Network and other Operations Centers.</t></abstract></front>
