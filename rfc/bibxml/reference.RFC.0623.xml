<abstract>
<t>Peter Deutsch in RFC #606 pointed out the desirability of having a single host maintain a data base containing official host names and host addresses, as well as other information of secondary importance.  Mike Kudlick in RFC #608 agreed with the concept, and proposed that the NIC would implement Peter's ideas.  I would like to add my voice to those in support of such a service, and express a few ideas for its modification.</t></abstract></front>
