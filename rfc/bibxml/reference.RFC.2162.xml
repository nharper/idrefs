<abstract>
<t>This document describes a set of mappings which will enable inter working between systems operating the ISO/IEC 10021 - CCITT (now ITU)  X.400 Recommendations on Message Handling Systems, and systems running the Mail-11 (also known as DECnet mail or VMSmail) protocol. The specifications are valid both within DECnet Phase IV and DECnet/OSI addressing and routing scheme.</t>
<t>The complete scenario of X.400 / MIME / Mail-11 is also considered, in order to cover the possible complex cases arising in multiple gateway translations.</t>
<t>This document covers mainly the X.400 O/R address to/from Mail-11 address mapping and the RFC822 to/from Mail-11 ones; other mappings are based on MIXER specifications. Bodypart mappings are not specified in this document: MIXER and MIME-MHS specifications can be applied to map bodyparts between X.400, MIME and Mail-11, too. In fact MIME encoding can be used without modifications within Mail-11 text bodyparts.</t>
<t>This document obsoletes RFC 1405, which was a combined effort of TERENA Working Group on Messaging, and the IETF X.400 Ops Working Group. This update was prepared by IETF MIXER working group.</t></abstract></front>
