<abstract>
<t>I would like to second Edwin Meyer's (RFC #492) strong opposition to the proposals made in RFC #467 concerning solutions to the "lost allocate" and "half-closed" phenomena.  In particular I support all of his principles concerning the "half-closed" phenomenon.  I also agree that the proposed "lost allocate" solution tends to mask the real problem of lost messages.  I would, however, like to propose the following alternative scheme for recognizing lost messages.</t></abstract></front>
