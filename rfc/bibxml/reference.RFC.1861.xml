<abstract>
<t>This RFC suggests a simple way for delivering wireless messages, both one and two-way, to appropriate receiving devices.  In its simplest form, SNPP provides a simple way to implement a "shim" between the Internet and a TAP/IXO paging terminal. In its level 3 form, it provides an easy-to-use (and build) method for communicating and receiving end-to-end acknowledgments and replies from two-way messaging devices (such as ReFLEX units).</t>
<t>Gateways supporting this protocol, as well as SMTP, have been in use for well over a year at several commercial paging companies, and private businesses.  Client software supporting this protocol has become widespread, and is being integrated into many of the new paging and messaging products being built.  In addition to commercial software, email filters and SNPP client software for Unix and Windows (WikiPage) are available at no cost.  Please contact the author for more information.</t>
<t>Earlier versions of this specification were reviewed by IESG members and the "822 Extensions" Working Group.  They preferred an alternate strategy, as discussed under "Relationship to Other IETF Work",
