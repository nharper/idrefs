<abstract>
<t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. This memo obsoletes RFC 2358, "Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types".
This memo extends that specification by including management information useful for the management of 1000 Mb/s and full-duplex Ethernet interfaces.</t>
<t>Ethernet technology, as defined by the 802.3 Working Group of the IEEE, continues to evolve, with scalable increases in speed, new types of cabling and interfaces, and new features. This evolution may require changes in the managed objects in order to reflect this new functionality. This document, as with other documents issued by this working group, reflects a certain stage in the evolution of Ethernet technology. In the future, this document might be revised, or new documents might be issued by the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB Working Group, in order to reflect the evolution of Ethernet
technology.</t></abstract></front>
