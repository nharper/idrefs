<abstract>
<t>Bill Crowther's RFC No. 67raised a much more  fundamental  issue than  the  question  of marking.  Any change to presently established protocol  is  going  to  involve  changes  in  the  hardware/software development  efforts  that have, in some instances, been going on for over 6 months.  In the case  of  Multics,  this  effort  has  yielded programs  either  complete or in the advanced debugging stages.  This is no doubt true for many other sites as well.</t></abstract></front>
