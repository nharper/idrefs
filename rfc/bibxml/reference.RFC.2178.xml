<abstract>
<t>This memo documents version 2 of the OSPF protocol. OSPF is a link-state routing protocol.  It is designed to be run internal to a single Autonomous System.  Each OSPF router maintains an identical database describing the Autonomous System's topology.  From this database, a routing table is calculated by constructing a shortest-path tree.</t>
<t>OSPF recalculates routes quickly in the face of topological changes, utilizing a minimum of routing protocol traffic.  OSPF provides support for equal-cost multipath.  An area routing capability is provided, enabling an additional level of routing protection and a reduction in routing protocol traffic.  In addition, all OSPF routing protocol exchanges are authenticated.</t>
<t>The differences between this memo and RFC 1583 are explained in Appendix G. All differences are backward-compatible in nature. Implementations of this memo and of RFC 1583 will interoperate.</t>
