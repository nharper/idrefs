<abstract>
<t>This document illustrates the growth of the Internet by examination of entries in the Domain Name System (DNS) and pre-DNS host tables. DNS entries are collected by a program called ZONE, which searches the Internet and retrieves data from all known domains.  Pre-DNS host table data were retrieved from system archive tapes.  Various statistics are presented on the number of hosts and domains.</t></abstract></front>
