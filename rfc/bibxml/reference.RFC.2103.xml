<t>
   We discuss the issue of mobility in Nimrod.  While a mobility
   solution is not part of the Nimrod architecture, Nimrod does require
   that the solution have certain characteristics.  We identify the
   requirements that Nimrod has of any solution for mobility support.
   We also classify and compare existing approaches for supporting
   mobility within an internetwork and discuss their advantages and
   disadvantages.  Finally, as an example, we outline the mechanisms to
   support mobility in Nimrod using the scheme currently being developed
   within the IETF - namely, the Mobile-IP protocol.
