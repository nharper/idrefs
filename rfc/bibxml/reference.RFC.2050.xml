   This document describes the IP assignment policies currently used by
   the Regional Registries to implement the guidelines developed by the
   IANA. The guidelines and these policies are subject to revision at
   the direction of the IANA. The registry working group (IRE WG) will
   be discussing these issues and may provide advice to the IANA about
   possible revisions.

   This document replaces RFC 1466, with all the guidelines and
   procedures updated and modified in the light of experience.
   This document does not describe private Internet address space and
   multicast address space.  It also does not describe regional and
   local refinements of the global rules and guidelines.
