<abstract>
<t>RFC 1264 was written during what was effectively a completely different time in the life of the Internet.  It prescribed rules to protect the Internet against new routing protocols that may have various undesirable properties.  In today's Internet, there are so many other pressures against deploying unreasonable protocols that we believe that existing controls suffice, and the RFC 1264 rules just get in the way.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>
