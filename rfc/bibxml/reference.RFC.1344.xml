<abstract>
<t>The recent development of MIME (Multipurpose  Internet Mail Extensions)  offers  a  wide  range of new opportunities for electronic mail system systems.  Most of these  opportunites are relevant only to user agents, the programs that interact with human users when they send and receive mail.   However, some  opportunities  are  also  opened up for mail transport systems.  While MIME was carefully designed so that it  does not  require  any  changes  to  Internet  electronic message transport  facilities,  there  are  several  ways  in  which message  transport  systems  may  want  to take advantage of MIME.  These opportunities are the subject of this memo.</t></abstract></front>
