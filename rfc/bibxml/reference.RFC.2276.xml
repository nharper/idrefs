   This document addresses the issues of the discovery of URN (Uniform
   Resource Name) resolver services that in turn will directly translate
   URNs into URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and URCs (Uniform Resource
   Characteristics).  The document falls into three major parts, the
   assumptions underlying the work, the guidelines in order to be a
   viable Resolver Discovery Service or RDS, and a framework for
   designing RDSs.  The guidelines fall into three principle areas:
   evolvability, usability, and security and privacy.  An RDS that is
   compliant with the framework will not necessarily be compliant with
   the guidelines.  Compliance with the guidelines will need to be
   validated separately.
