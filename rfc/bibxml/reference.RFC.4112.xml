<abstract>
<t>Electronic commerce frequently requires a substantial exchange of information in order to complete a purchase or other transaction, especially the first time the parties communicate.  A standard set of hierarchically-organized payment-related information field names in an XML syntax is defined so that this task can be more easily automated.
