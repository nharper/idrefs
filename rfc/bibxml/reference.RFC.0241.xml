<abstract>
<t>Several times we have been asked if computers can be connected through serial communication lines to ports on the Terminal IMP's Multi-Line Controller (MLC) [related questions about the level of software support provided by the Terminal IMP to such a connection, have also been raised].  In the past we have said, "Please don't!" We now say, "Sure, but will that really help you the way you think it will?"</t></abstract></front>
