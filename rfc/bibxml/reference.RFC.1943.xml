<abstract>
<t>This document provides definition and recommends considerations that must be undertaken to operate a X.500 Directory Service in the United States.  This project is the work performed for the Integrated Directory Services Working Group within the Internet Engineering Task Force, for establishing an electronic White Pages Directory Service within an organization in the US and for connecting it to a wide-area Directory infrastructure.</t>
<t>Establishing a successful White Pages Directory Service within an organization requires a collaborative effort between the technical, legal and data management components of an organization. It also helps if there is a strong commitment from the higher management to participate in a wide-area Directory Service.</t>
<t>The recommendations presented in the document are the result of experience from participating in the Internet White Pages project.</t></abstract></front>
