<abstract>
<t>This memo describes a profile for the use of the real-time transport protocol (RTP), version 2, and the associated control protocol, RTCP, within audio and video multiparticipant conferences with minimal control. It provides interpretations of generic fields within the RTP specification suitable for audio and video conferences.  In particular, this document defines a set of default mappings from payload type numbers to encodings.</t>
<t>The document also describes how audio and video data may be carried within RTP. It defines a set of standard encodings and their names when used within RTP. However, the encoding definitions are independent of the particular transport mechanism used. The descriptions provide pointers to reference implementations and the detailed standards. This document is meant as an aid for implementors of audio, video and other real-time multimedia applications.</t></abstract></front>
