<abstract>
<t>This document specifies three sets of new ciphersuites for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support authentication based on pre-shared keys (PSKs).  These pre-shared keys are symmetric keys, shared in advance among the communicating parties.  The first set of ciphersuites uses only symmetric key operations for authentication.  The second set uses a Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated with a pre-shared key, and the third set combines public key authentication of the server with pre-shared key authentication of the client.
