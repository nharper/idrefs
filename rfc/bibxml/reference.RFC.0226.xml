<abstract>
<t>IN EACH TELNET IMPLEMENTATION, A LIST OF HOST NMEUMONICS IS PROVIDED FOR THE USER TO INDICATE THE SERVING HOST DESIRED.  CURRENTLY, EACH SITE EMPLOYS THEIR OWN SPECIAL LIST.  RATHER THAN REQUIRE THE USER TO BE COGNIZANT OF THE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF EACH LIST, ESPECIALLY WHEN CHAINED THROUGH SEVERAL HOSTS VIA TELNET, IT HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED THAT STANDARD HOST DESIGNATORS BE ADOPTED.</t>
<t>THE FOLLOWING LIST OF SIX CHARACTER DESIGNATORS IS PROPOSED AS THE STANDARD LIST.  REGISTER ANY OBJECTIONS BY 3 OCTOBER TO P. KARP (703) 893-3500 X2391, X2318. AN OFFICIAL POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION DATE WILL BE SET ON 8 OCTOBER.</t></abstract></front>
