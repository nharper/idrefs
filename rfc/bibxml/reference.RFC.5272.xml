<abstract>
<t>This document defines the base syntax for CMC, a Certificate Management protocol using the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). This protocol addresses two immediate needs within the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) community:&lt;/t>&lt;t> 1. The need for an interface to public key certification products and services based on CMS and PKCS #10 (Public Key Cryptography Standard), and&lt;/t>&lt;t> 2. The need for a PKI enrollment protocol for encryption only keys due to algorithm or hardware design.&lt;/t>&lt;t> CMC also requires the use of the transport document and the requirements usage document along with this document for a full definition.
