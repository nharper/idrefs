<abstract>
<t>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a method for transmitting datagrams over serial point-to-point links.  PPP is composed of three parts:</t>
<t>1. A method for encapsulating datagrams over serial links.</t>
<t>2. An extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP).</t>
<t>3. A family of Network Control Protocols (NCP) for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols.</t>
<t>This document defines the encapsulation scheme, the basic LCP, and an NCP for establishing and configuring the Internet Protocol (IP) (called the IP Control Protocol, IPCP).</t>
<t>The options and facilities used by the LCP and the IPCP are defined in separate documents.  Control protocols for configuring and utilizing other network-layer protocols besides IP (e.g., DECNET, OSI) are expected to be developed as needed.</t></abstract></front>
