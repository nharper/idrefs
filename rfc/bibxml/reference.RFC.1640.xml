<abstract>
<t>This report, originally prepared in January 1993 provides a summary of the POISED WG, starting from the events leading to the formation of the WG to the end of 1992.  Necessarily, this synopsis represents my own perception, particularly for the "prehistory" period.  Quite a few people hold strong views about both the overall sequence and specific events.  My intent here is to convey as neutral a point of view as possible.</t></abstract></front>
