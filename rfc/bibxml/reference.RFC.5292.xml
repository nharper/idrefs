<t>This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for BGP, termed "Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", that can be used to perform address-prefix-based route filtering.  This ORF-type supports prefix-length- or range-based matching, wild-card-based address prefix matching, as well as the exact address prefix matching for address families.
