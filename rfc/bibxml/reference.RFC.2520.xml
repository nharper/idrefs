<abstract>
<t>This document describes an extension to NHRPwhich would allow Mobile NHCs to perform a registration with and attach to an NHS in their home LIS in an authenticated manner.</t>
<t>As described in this document, Mobile NHCs are NHCs which are not configured with enough information to find a specific serving NHS in their home LIS, but which have a mechanism to find an NHS (which may or may not be a serving NHS) to which they will attach.  As described in, an NHC may attach to a 'surrogate' NHS by using a mechanism such as an anycast address.  In this case, the NHC may use the surrogate NHS to send a NHRP Registration Request toward the NHC's home LIS where a serving NHS resides.  However, as defined in, packet authentication is performed on a hop by hop basis.  In the mobile NHC case, it is not practical for the mobile NHC be in a security relationship with every surrogate NHS, thus it is presumably desirable to have some form of end to end only authentication for the case of a mobile NHC's registration.  This document describes an authentication extension for NHRP which has such end to end only semantics.</t></abstract></front>
