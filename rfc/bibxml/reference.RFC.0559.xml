<t>We at MIT-DN have implemented the new TELNET protocol (both server and user).  This RFC describes our experience with the implementation (particularly the use of GO AHEAD) and in bringing the new User and Server TELNET's in operation (the new TELNET is not compatible with the old).  We have a few suggestions here which should help other implementors and lead to a smoother transition to the new protocol.</t></abstract></front>
