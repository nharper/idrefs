<abstract>
<t>From time to time it is necessary for an IMP or TIP to be taken down other than during its scheduled Preventive Maintenance period.  Examples of such cases are retrofit programs and the off-line diagnosis and repair of intermittent problems. In the past we have scheduled these downs with our "primary site contact" at the affected site; in our view this individual was responsible for representing all of the hosts (and TIP users) connected to that IMP/TIP. Although this policy has worked well in the past, the recent proliferation of Very Distant Hosts, together with complaints from representatives of other (local or distant) Hosts, has caused us to review our procedures.</t></abstract></front>
