<abstract>
<t>In RFC #226, Peggy Karp suggested that there be a set of standard host names, that the names be 6 characters in length, and gave a partial list.  In RFC #229, I suggested 8 character names and gave a longer list.  Here I present my list again with some modifications.</t>
<t>I also suggest that as far as possible the Standard host names be consistent with the site names used by the Network Information Center.  It also seems to me to be a good idea to consult with each host's technical liaison officer before assigning that host's name.</t></abstract></front>
