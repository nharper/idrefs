<abstract>
<t>This RFC specifies a standard adopted by CSNET, the VAN gateway, and other organizations for the transmission of IP datagrams over the X.25-based public data networks.</t>
<t>An X.25 virtual circuit is opened on demand when a datagram arrives at the network interface for transmission. A virtual circuit is closed after some period of inactivity (the length of the period depends on
the cost associated with an open virtual circuit). A virtual circuit may also be closed if the interface runs out of virtual circuits. An algorithm for managing virtual circuits during peak demand is given in.</t></abstract></front>
