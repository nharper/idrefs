<abstract>
<t>This memo examines some of the issues associated with the current management practices of the Internet IPv4 address space, and examines the potential outcomes of these practices as the unallocated address pool shrinks in size.  Possible modifications to the management practices are examined, and potential outcomes considered.  Some general conclusions are drawn, and the relevance of these conclusions to the matter of formulation of address management policies for IPv6 are noted.</t></abstract></front>
