<abstract>
<t>The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) has been in use in the Internet for a decade, and remains one of the most popular protocols (by volume) in use today.  This document is a replacement for RFC 977, and officially updates the protocol specification.  It clarifies some vagueness in RFC 977, includes some new base functionality, and provides a specific mechanism to add standardized extensions to NNTP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
