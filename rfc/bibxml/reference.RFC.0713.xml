<abstract>
<t>A mechanism is defined for use by message servers in transferring data between hosts.  The mechanism, called the MSDTP, is defined in terms of a model of the process as a translation between two sets of items, the abstract entities such as 'strings' and 'integers', and the formats used to represent such data as a byte stream.</t>
<t>A proposed organization of a general data transfer mechanism is described, and the manner in which the MSDTP would be used in that environment is presented.</t></abstract></front>
