<abstract>
<t>This memo is an informational RFC which outlines one potential approach for inter-domain routing in future global internets.  The focus is on scalability to very large networks and functionality, as well as scalability, to support routing in an environment of heterogeneous services, requirements, and route selection criteria.</t>
