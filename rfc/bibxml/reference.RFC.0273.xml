<t>The Network Information Center is a logical place to handle this problem of Standard Host Names and so the ball now rests here. This is clearly a delicate subject with people having strong feelings and attachments to names.  No past proposal, including RFC 247, NIC 7668, has yet achieved any acceptance.  This identification seems a natural thing and should be taken into account in setting up a naming scheme.  Therefore, the following proposal is offered which I hope may be satisfactory to everyone.</t></abstract></front>
