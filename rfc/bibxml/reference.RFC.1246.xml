<abstract>
<t>This is the second of two reports on the OSPF protocol. These reports are required by the IAB/IESG in order for an Internet routing protocol to advance to Draft Standard Status. OSPF is a TCP/IP routing protocol, designed to be used internal to an Autonomous System (in other words, OSPF is an Interior Gateway Protocol).</t>
<t>OSPF is currently designated as a Proposed Standard. Version 1 of the OSPF protocol was published in RFC 1131. Since then OSPF version 2 has been developed. Version 2 has been documented in RFC 1247.  The changes between version 1 and version 2 of the OSPF protocol are explained in Appendix F of RFC 1247. It is OSPF Version 2 that is the subject of this report.</t>
<t>This report documents experience with OSPF V2. This includes reports on interoperability testing, field experience, simulations and the current state of OSPF implementations. It also presents a summary of the OSPF Management Information Base (MIB), and a summary of OSPF authentication mechanism.</t>
