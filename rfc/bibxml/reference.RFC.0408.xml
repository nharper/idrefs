<abstract>
<t>The following idea for a protocol (or service) is offered as an aid to network use for new users:</t>
<t>a single billing and account creation and validation system, so that a manager of a "goal oriented project" could:</t>
<t>authorize a set of user's ids to gain access to and utilize resources at the entire or a specified subset of the server hosts.</t>
<t>create a set of accounts which the users will expend, and which will be used as the breakdown for a single bill to be presented to the project manager.</t></abstract></front>
