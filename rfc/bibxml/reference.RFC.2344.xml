<t>
   Mobile IP uses tunneling from the home agent to the mobile node's

   care-of address, but rarely in the reverse direction.  Usually, a

   mobile node sends its packets through a router on the foreign

   network, and assumes that routing is independent of source address.

   When this assumption is not true, it is convenient to establish a

   topologically correct reverse tunnel from the care-of address to the

   home agent.

<t>


   This document proposes backwards-compatible extensions to Mobile IP

   in order to support topologically correct reverse tunnels.  This

   document does not attempt to solve the problems posed by firewalls

   located between the home agent and the mobile node's care-of address.
