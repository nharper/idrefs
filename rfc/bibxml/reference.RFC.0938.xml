<t>The Internet Reliable Transaction Protocol (IRTP) is a transport level host to host protocol designed for an internet environment.  It provides reliable, sequenced delivery of packets of data between hosts and multiplexes/demultiplexes streams of packets from/to user processes representing ports.  It is simple to implement, with a minimum of connection management, at the possible expense of efficiency.</t></abstract></front>
