<abstract>
<t>This RFCconsiders certain deficiencies of the 1988 X.500 standard, which need to be addressed before an effective open Internet Directory can be established using these protocols and services.  The only areas considered are primary problems, to which solutions must be found before a pilot can be deployed.  This RFCconcerns itself with deficiencies which can only be addressed by use of ditional protocol or procedures for distributed operation.</t></abstract></front>
