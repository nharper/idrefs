<abstract>
<t>In the next few weeks several changes will be made to the IMP software including changes to the IMP/Host software interface as specified in BBN Report No. 1822, Specifications for the Interconnection of a Host and an IMP. These changes come in four areas: a) decoupling of the message number sequences of Hosts; b) Host/Host access control; c) expansion of the message number window from four to eight; and d) provision for messages outside the normal message number mechanism. All changes are backward compatible with possible minor exceptions in timing.</t></abstract></front>
