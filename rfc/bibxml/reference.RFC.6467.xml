<t>This document defines a generic way for Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) to use any of the symmetric secure password authentication methods.  Multiple methods are already specified in other documents, and this document does not add any new one.  This document specifies a way to agree on which method is to be used in the current connection.  This document also provides a common way to transmit, between peers, payloads that are specific to secure password authentication methods.</t></abstract></front>
