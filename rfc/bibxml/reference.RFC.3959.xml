<abstract>
<t>This document defines a new disposition type (early-session) for the Content-Disposition header field in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The treatment of "early-session" bodies is similar to the treatment of "session" bodies.  That is, they follow the offer/answer model.  Their only difference is that session descriptions whose disposition type is "early-session" are used to establish early media sessions within early dialogs, as opposed to regular sessions within regular dialogs.
