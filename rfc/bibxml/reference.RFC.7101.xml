<abstract>
<t>At one time, the RFC Editor published snapshots of the "Internet Official Protocol Standards".  These documents were known as xx00 documents, the last of which was published in May 2008.  These snapshots have been replaced by a web page, so the RFC Editor will no longer be publishing these snapshots as RFCs.  As a result, the RFC Editor will classify unpublished RFC xx00 numbers through 7000 as never issued.  Starting with the RFC number 7100, xx00 numbers will be available for assignment.</t></abstract></front>
