<t>
   The IMAP extension described here assumes a particular means of using
   IMAP to support disconnected operation.  However, this means of
   supporting disconnected operation is not yet documented.  Also, there
   are multiple theories about how best to do disconnected operation in
   IMAP, and as yet, there is no consensus on which one should be
   adopted as a standard.
</t>
<t>
   This document is being approved as a Proposed Standard because it
   does not appear to have technical flaws in itelf.  However, approval
   of this document as a Proposed Standard should not be considered an
   IETF endorsement of any particular means of doing disconnected
   operation in IMAP.
