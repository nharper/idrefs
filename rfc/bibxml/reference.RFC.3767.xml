<abstract>
<t>This document describes a protocol whereby a user can acquire cryptographic credentials (e.g., private keys, PKCS #15 structures) from a credential server, using a workstation that has locally trusted software installed, but with no user-specific configuration.  The protocol's payloads are described in XML.  This memo also specifies a Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) profile of the protocol.  Security requirements are met by mandating support for TLS and/or DIGEST-MD5 (through BEEP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
