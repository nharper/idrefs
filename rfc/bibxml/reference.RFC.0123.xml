<abstract>
<t>By Initial Connection Protocol (ICP), I mean a third level protocol which is initiated by a user process at one site in order to contact a server process at another site.  Typically, the user process will be a Telnet and the server process will be a logger, but there may be other cases.</t>
<t>In this RFC, I wish to describe a family of ICPs suitable for establishing one pair of connections (one in each direction) between any user process and any server process, and to propose further a particular subset of this family as the standard ICP for connecting user processes to loggers on systems which accept teletype-like devices.</t></abstract></front>
