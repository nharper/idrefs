<abstract>
<t>At the October 1971 Network Working Group Meeting, I promised to promptly produce a document which clearly and succinctly specified and explained the Official Telnet Protocol.  This document fails to meet any part of that promise.  This document was not produced promptly.  This document is neither clear nor succinct.  There is NO Official Telnet Protocol.</t>
<t>The following pages present my understanding of the ad hoc Telnet protocol.  There are some who have serious questions about this protocol.  The proposed changes to the protocol are given in Section IV.</t></abstract></front>
