<abstract>
<t>Some aspects of the BOOTP protocol were rather loosely defined in its original specification.  In particular, only a general description was provided for the behavior of "BOOTP relay agents" (originally called BOOTP forwarding agents").  The client behavior description also suffered in certain ways.  This memo attempts to clarify and strengthen the specification in these areas.  Due to some errors introduced into RFC 1532 in the editorial process, this memo is reissued as RFC 1542.</t>
<t>In addition, new issues have arisen since the original specification was written.  This memo also attempts to address some of these.</t></abstract></front>
